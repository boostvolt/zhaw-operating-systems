## Agent-Solved Labs: How It Works

These labs have been solved by an automated agent designed for technical accuracy and reproducibility:

- The agent reads each lab's instructions and executes all required shell commands directly on the provided SSH server (`ssh ubuntu@160.85.31.224`).
- Every command output and system behavior is captured from the real serverâ€”no outputs are fabricated or assumed.
- The agent documents each step by appending real outputs and concise technical explanations after each lab task, clearly marked for exam preparation.
- All lab markdown files preserve the original instructions, with agent findings and outputs added as clearly marked sections.
- New labs are automatically linked in this README for easy navigation.

This approach ensures that all solutions are authentic, technically sound, and ready for exam review.
